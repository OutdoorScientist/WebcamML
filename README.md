## About

In an increasingly digital era, webcams are becoming more necessary as online meetings are becoming the norm inside
of everyday life. This newfound webcam importance has highlighted an important issue those with visual impairments face.
Webcams are an entirely visually focused media and have no way of providing feedback besides visually.
We are here to accomadate that issue by providing auditory cues to center a users face in the webcam such as "move up",
"move down", "move left" and "move right". This will enable those who typically do not benefit from webcams to use them for things such as 
video calls with family, remote work, and any teleconferencing needs. </p>
